LEGAL PRINCIPLES

1. BREACH OF CONTRACT
A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform their obligations under the contract. There are two types of breaches:
- Material breach: A significant failure that goes to the heart of the contract
- Minor breach: A less significant failure that does not substantially affect the contract

2. DAMAGES
When a breach occurs, the non-breaching party may be entitled to damages:
- Compensatory damages: To compensate for actual losses
- Punitive damages: To punish the breaching party (rare in contract cases)
- Liquidated damages: Pre-agreed damages specified in the contract

3. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
In some cases, a court may order specific performance, requiring the breaching party to fulfill their contractual obligations.

4. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
Contract claims must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations period, which varies by jurisdiction.
